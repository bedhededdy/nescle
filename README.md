 # NESCLE
 ## What is NESCLE?
 NESCLE (pronounced like Nestl√©) is a free and open-source NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator written
 in the C programming language, with minimal sections of the code (mostly front-end) writen in C++. It uses SDL2 for audio
 and input, OpenGL 3.3+ for graphics, and Dear ImGui for the graphical user interface. NESCLE will eventually provide a
 terminal user interface for users who prefer using the command line.

 ### Why C?
 Most popular NES emulators are almost exclusively written in C++, and many newer, lesser used emulators are
 written in Rust. Knowing little (modern) C++ and no Rust, but still requiring the high-performance of those languages,
 I chose to rely on an old friend, C. This makes NESCLE unique among the existing NES emulators, as the code (mostly)
 maintains the readability of C code compared to the often hard to parse C++ code.
 I do not claim to be the only person to write a NES emulator in C,
 but I do claim that popular forms of such emulators are rare.
 As SDL and OpenGL are C libraries,
 choosing to write the entire project in C++ would lead to even more clumsy integration between the C and C++ code than there already is.
 Even the C++ code in NESCLE is mostly written like C code as much as possible. This is because C++, specifically modern C++, contains many
 problems that make code hard to read for those who are not well versed in its nuances (ex. `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`,
 `std::static_cast` and `std::reinterpret_cast`, references vs. pointers, templates, etc).

 ## Requirements and Dependencies
 As of now, NESCLE has not been packaged for any operating system. This means that you have to compile it yourself from the source code.
 To build the code you need a C compiler that supports the C11 and C++11
 standards.

 Requirements:
 * CMake 3.15+
 * A C/C++ compiler that supports C11+ and C++11+
 * A build system
 * A graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3+

 This software makes use of the following third-party libraries:
 * SDL2 under the terms and conditions of the [zlib license](https://www.libsdl.org/license.php)
 * Dear ImGui under the terms and conditions of the [MIT license](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
 * Native File Dialog Extended under the terms and conditions of the [zlib license](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Installation
Installing NESCLE is extremely easy. The only tricky part is that
you will need to manually install glad. Everything else will be
handled for you by CMake. But if you follow the following steps,
everything should be A-Okay
1. Go to the following [link](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
2. Under the gl dropdown, select Version 3.3
3. Under the Profile dropdown, select Core
4. Click generate
5. Download and extract the zip file to the root directory of the project and make sure the directory you extract to is named "glad"
6. Create a build directory and cd into it
7. Run `cmake --build ..`
8. To run NESCLE, just type ./nescle

 ## Acknowledgements
 I would like to provide a massive thank you to javidx9 (aka the One Lone Coder) for his excellent YouTube series
 on NES emulation and to the SimpleNES repository for providing countless help and inspiration for my own emulator
 implementation. By no means does this software copy verbatim from either of their implementations, nor any other
 NES emulator implementation, this is simply an acknowledgement that those sources were used by me as inspiration.
 The NESdev wiki also deserves a mention as a "one-stop shop" for finding out information about the NES.
