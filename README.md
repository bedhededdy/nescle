 # NESCLE
 ## What is NESCle?
 NESCle (pronounced like Nestl√©) is a free and open-source NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator written
 the C programming language, with minimal parts of the front-end written in C++.
 
 ## Why C?
 Most commonly used NES emulators are almost exclusively written in C++, and many newer, lesser used emulators are
 written in Rust. Knowing little C++ and no Rust, but still requiring the high-performance of those languages,
 I chose to rely on an old friend, C. This makes NESCle unique among the existing NES emulators, as the code (mostly)
 maintains the readability of C code compared to the often hard to parse, bloated C++ code.

 ## Special Thanks
 I would like to provide a massive thank you to javidx9 (aka the One Lone Coder) for his excellent YouTube series
 on NES emulation and to the SimpleNES repository for providing countless help and inspiration for my own emulator
 implementation. By no means does this software copy verbatim from either of their implementations, nor any other
 NES emulator implementation, this is simply an acknowledgement that those sources were used by me as inspiration.
